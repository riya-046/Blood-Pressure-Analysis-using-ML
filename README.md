# Blood-Pressure-Analysis-using-ML
A project utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict blood pressure fluctuations.It monitors real-time physiological data such as heart rate, activity levels, and other relevant biometrics.This data is fed into advanced machine learning models hosted on IBM Cloud, which analyze patterns to forecast changes in blood pressure.

## Features
- Trains multiple ML models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes.
- Compares model accuracy and automatically selects the best performing model.
- Web application interface to input patient data and predict blood pressure.
- Model saved using `pickle` for deployment.
